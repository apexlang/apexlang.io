## Installation

First, make sure you have [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install) installed.

### CLI

The command line interface is a single binary that generates code from Apex documents.
The Apex CLI is installed from the terminal/command prompt by executing the command below.

```shell
deno install -A --unstable -f -n apex https://deno.land/x/apex_cli/apex.ts
```

```shell
apex --help
```

Output:

```
  Usage:   apex
  Version: 0.0.2
  Description:
    A code generation tool using Apex, an interface definition language (IDL) for modeling software.
  Options:
    -h, --help  - Show this help.
  Commands:
    new          <template> <dir>    - Create a new project directory using a template.
    init         <template>          - Initialize a project using a template.
    generate     [configuration...]  - Run apex generators from a given configuration.

```


The scripts download the latest release and copies the binary into your PATH. You can also install manually from [releases](https://github.com/apexlang/cli/releases) or build from source from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/apexlang/cli).

### VS Code extension

Installing this extension is **recommended** but not required. It enables the following features while editing Apex documents:

* Syntax highlighting
* Completions
* Parsing and validation checks
* Go to definition

Search for `apexlang` in the extension marketplace and click "Install". You can also build from source from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/apexlang/vscode-extension).

Alternatively, if `code` is in your PATH, you can also install by executing this command from a terminal.

```shell
code --install-extension apexlang.apexlang
```
